# QUIZZICAL

Quizzical is an interactive quiz website that provides users with a quiz round on random topics.
Each round consists of 10 questions, and provides instant feedback on whether the answers are correct in the form of text and color codes. The correct answer score is tallied on the quiz page, allowing users to keep track of each round.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

- `#000000` used for dark.
- `#ffffff` used for light.
- `#f2f2f2` used for grey.
- `#8f52d1` used for light purp. 
- `#6c4298` used for dark purp. 
- `#b1fdb1` used for light blue. 
- `#4c55cc99` used to highlight some text areas 


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/6c4298-8f52d1-1ba7c0-ffffff-f2f2f2-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Features
- **Features on all pages-**
- Favicon appears on the browser tab across all pages (images/quizfavicon.png)
- Title links back to index page (images/titlelink.png)

- **Home Page**
- The home page consists of a background image depicting a school chalkboard, with various themes written on the board. It holds a container, consisting of a welcome message and some basic instructions for use. Below the information, we have three buttons each with their own function. 
How to play: When clicked, this button will open a modal with game instructions. The modal covers the entire page, andf includes a close button. When the close button is clicked, the modal will disappear to reveal the landing page again. 
Play: When clicked, this will initiate the first round of the quiz. The quiz area contains a clickable title which will return the user to the landing page. It also hosts a container, resppnsible for holding the quiz question, a progress counter, a category section for each question and the four answer buttons. Below this, we have a 'Check Answer' button.
 (images/titlelink.png)

- **The Game Page**
- For ease of navigation, the title acts as a clickable link to return the user to the landing page at any time. The quiz calls an API to generate the questions, in rounds of 10. When the question is displayed, the user can select one of four possible answers. Clicking the 'Check Answer' button will compare the users selection with the data from the API and display confirmation of either correct or incorrect answer. As well as a text prompt for the result, a background color has been used for further aesthetic feedback. For correct answers, the user will see green background. For incorrect, the user will see red background. 
The question counter will display how many correct answers have been provided until that point in time. Once the user has answered 10 questions, the round will be complete and their score will be displayed. 


### Future Features

With additional time to spend on this project, I believe the below features would improve the overall user experience. 

- Difficulty Levels
    - Allow user to select different levels of difficulty such as easy, medium and hard. 
- Progress Bar 
    - Introduce a visual progress bar to correspond with the. question counter. 
- Timer
    - Introduce a countdown timer for each question, mutable by the user. 
- Team build
    - Allow storage of scores employing a backend dadabase, to allow teams to play against each other while keeping track of success.
